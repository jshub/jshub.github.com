Notes
=====

* Care should be taken with root relative links as the site may not always be at the same level in a hierarchy.
* The target directory needs to be writable by the `capistrano` user.
* By default Jekyll will merge the generated files with those existing at the target location. 
  Occasional pruning will be required after any rearrangement.
* There are a number of symlinks used by Passenger to serve Rails apps as part of the site.
  If these are deleted you can use the relevant projects `cap deploy:setup` task to recreate them.
