How-to
======

* To generate the site into the _site folder: `jekyll`
* To run the site locally for development, run `jekyll --server --auto` which creates an http server on localhost:4000
* To deploy to staging environment, just commit in the master branch and `git push origin master` (or just git push). It will be deployed to http://jshub.github.com/ NB this is open and public although not linked, so don't put anything secret here!
* To deploy to the live server on http://jshub.org/ run `cap deploy`
* To test the links:
   * Install from http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/
   * `linkchecker http://fiann.local:4000/ --file-output=html/linkchecker-out.html` then `open linkchecker-out.html`. 
   * Seems to be broken for root relative links, though.


Notes
=====

* Care should be taken with root relative links as the site may not always be at the same level in a hierarchy.
* The target directory needs to be writable by the `capistrano` user.
* By default Jekyll will merge the generated files with those existing at the target location. 
  Occasional pruning will be required after any rearrangement.
* There are a number of symlinks used by Passenger to serve Rails apps as part of the site.
  If these are deleted you can:
  * use `cap custom:link_webroot` to make them if it is up-to-date or
  * use the relevant projects `cap deploy:setup` task to recreate them.
