    <h1>What?</h1>
    
    <p>
      jsHub is an open source project created to eliminate the problems of
      web page tagging overload and data inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/projects/jshub/">jsHub tag</a> is written in JavaScript 
      and distributed under the BSD license.  It comes with a complete suite 
      of automated tests and cross browser continuous integration testing to 
      ensure its quality.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Based on standards</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure that data is only collected once the jsHub project is
      proposing a <a href="/projects/markup/">page markup standard</a> based
      on HTML microformats, and released into the public domain, for common 
      page metadata.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with tools</h2>
    <p>
      We provide a <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a> which shows all the data that is 
      being collected on the page. No more debugging your implementation by
      monitoring HTTP traffic and unescaping query strings in your head!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/projects/inspector/"><img src="/images/inspector/3InspectorOverview.png" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with best practice</h2>
    <p>
      There is a <a href="/projects/demos/">demo store</a> which shows the tag, markup and tag inspector
      working together. Giving you a real life example of how to deploy the code.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with tests</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a JavaScript developer, come and see how we do fully automated, cross-browser, continuous
      integration testing. How was our last build? You'll find the status and details of all the developer
      activity on the <a href="/projects/">projects page</a>.

    <h1>Why?</h1>
    
    <p>
      It is common for web pages to contain many different tracking tags
      used for web analytics, advertising tracking, targetting, audience
      measurement, and more.   Some sites have more than 10 tags per page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tag adds either HTML or JavaScript to the page adding to its
      weight: more tags means larger pages which means longer load times.
    </p>
    <p>
      And each tag ends up reading the same information from the page, such
      as its name, which can lead to inconsistencies.  Problems associated
      with page loads may cause one tag to fire and another to misfire: that
      leads to inconsistent results and headaches for web site owners in
      interpreting data from different tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      jsHub is designed to eliminate these problems by replacing many tags
      with a single tag.  The single jsHub tag reads data once from the page, 
      fires once, and replaces existing tags by sending data in native formats
      to different vendors&rsquo; products.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that implementing a tag-based product on your site should 
      not be an expensive exercise that locks you in to a single provider.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Who benefits from jsHub?</h2>
    <p>
      Vendors benefit because cross product data problems are eliminated as
      data is read once,  they can use common code eliminating most of their
      tag maintenance, and tag installation becomes easier as jsHub becomes
      widely adopted. <br/>
      See the <a href="/standards/">standards pages</a> for more. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Web site owners benefit from improved consistency of information
      across different products, lower tag weight and the assurance that the
      tag is widely tested and secure. <br/>
      For more on the cost of implementation, see the <a href="/enterprise/">enterprise
      page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>With the Tag Inspector web site owners can self-service and check
      tag implementation.<br/>
      On the <a href="/projects/demos/">demo site</a>, you can see the 
      inspector in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      End users benefit from faster page load times and greater
      transparency.  With a single tag pages are smaller and faster to load.
      With the Tag Inspector an end user can quickly see what information
      is being gathered about them.
