      Web sites typically connect to many different software services - web analytics, audience measurement, optimization, and many more. Each connection is made with a small piece of code called a &lsquo;tag&rsquo;. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sites have  10 or more tags on a page, and each one adds to the time it takes for the page to load. Each tag needs similar information to be written into the page, but in a slightly different format, and this can cause awkward inconsistencies.

      jsHub is a <a href="/projects/">suite of tools</a> and a <a href="/standards/">set of standards</a>, that help you to make better websites. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tagging doesn't have to be painful.

    <h1>Implement tags properly, and only once</h1>
    <p>
      Most companies are surprised by the effort of tagging a website. jsHub means you only need to do it once. It is a single, shared tag used by all the products you have on your site. Deploying a new software service on your site? Just add the relevant plugin to the tag and you're done.
    </p>
    <p>
      jsHub also provides helpful tools including the <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a>. It allows marketing teams to check that markup is correct, without needing to look at code. jsHub empowers the people who rely on the data, and make them less reliant on support from the busy IT team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the site, jsHub can help you with consistent information across different products, faster web browsing, easier implementations, and the assurance that the tag is widely tested and secure.

      Use jsHub to power your product
    </h1>
    <p>
      If your product uses tags to collect data from websites, then your enterprise customers spend a lot of time trying to reconcile your numbers with the other products they use on their website. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your enterprise customers also find that implementing the tags is expensive and time consuming. Prospective clients cannot try your product without investing effort upfront, and some will be stuck in a never-ending implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A standards-based implementation will make life easier for your customers. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      jsHub provides the technology. You help your clients to implement your product; there is no additional "universal tag" vendor between you and your client, and all our code and standards are completely free. When the industry works together, it's better for everyone.

    <p>
      Data should only be declared once. There is a better way than embedding data in vendor-specific JavaScript code on the page. Instead, we use a public domain <a href="/hPage/">open standard for page data</a>, covering the information needed by most optimization and analytics software. 
    </p>
    <div class="right" style="margin: 0 0.1em 0 0.6em; width: 55%;">
      <pre class="brush: html; light: true;">
        &lt;div class="hpage">
          &lt;span class="name">Homepage&lt;/span>
        &lt;/div>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The standard is based on HTML <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>. Microformat data can be indexed by search engines. Anyone who knows HTML can edit the data as part of the page content, and it can be properly integrated with your CMS. 
    </p>
    <p style="clear: both">
      Because the data can be read by any tag, you only declare it once. We believe that deploying software  products on your site should not be an expensive exercise in repeating yourself. Above all, it should not lock you in to the walled garden of proprietary markup for a single product. 
    </p>

      The jsHub tag is written in JavaScript and distributed under the BSD open source license.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a robust plugin architecture to provide consistent data to multiple products. It decouples the code that gathers information from the page, from the code that sends messages to your server. This allows big gains in security and code reuse.

    <p>
      If you work on a product that collects data from pages, then try creating a plugin for your product and see how easy it is to subscribe to the events you need to record (and create tests for it).
    </p>
    <p>
      And for any JavaScript developer interested in modern best practice, come and see how we do fully automated, cross-browser, continuous integration testing.
