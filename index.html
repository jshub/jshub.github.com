      jsHub is an open source project created to eliminate the problems of
      web page tagging overload and data inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the project is the <a href="/projects/jshub/">jsHub
      tag</a> is written in JavaScript and distributed under the BSD
      license.  It comes with a complete suite of automated tests and
      cross browser continuous integration to ensure its quality.

     </p>

     <p>
      To ensure that data is only collected once the jsHub project is
      proposing a <a href="/projects/markup/">page markup standard</a> based
      on HTML microformats, and released into the public domain, for common 
      page metadata.
    </p>

     </p>
    
     <p>
      We provide a <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a>
      which shows all the data that is being collected on the
      page. With the Tag Inspector it's possible to debug tag
      problems, check installed versions, or simply understand what
      information is being collected about the user.
    </p>

    </p>
    
     <p>
      There is a <a href="/projects/demos/">demo store</a> which shows
      the tag, markup and tag inspector working together. It gives you
      a real life example of how to deploy the code.
    </p>

      If you are a JavaScript developer, come and see how we do fully
      automated, cross-browser, continuous integration testing. How
      was our last build? You'll find the status and details of all
      the developer activity on the <a href="/projects/">projects
      page</a>.
