      <p>
        jsHub is an open source project created to eliminate the problems of
        web page tagging overload and data inconsistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heart of the project is the <a href="/projects/jshub/">jsHub
        tag</a> is written in JavaScript and distributed under the BSD
        license.  It comes with a complete suite of automated tests and
        cross browser continuous integration to ensure its quality.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        To ensure that data is only collected once the jsHub project is
        proposing a <a href="/projects/markup/">page markup standard</a> based
        on HTML microformats, and released into the public domain, for common 
        page metadata.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        We provide a <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a>
        which shows all the data that is being collected on the
        page. With the Tag Inspector it's possible to debug tag
        problems, check installed versions, or simply understand what
        information is being collected about the user.
      </p>

      </p>
      
       <p>
        There is a <a href="/projects/demos/">demo store</a> which shows
        the tag, markup and tag inspector working together. It gives you
        a real life example of how to deploy the code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you are a JavaScript developer, come and see how we do fully
        automated, cross-browser, continuous integration testing. How
        was our last build? You'll find the status and details of all
        the developer activity on the <a href="/projects/">projects
        page</a>.

      <h1>Why create jsHub?</h1>
      
      <p>
        It is common for web pages to contain many different tracking tags
        used for web analytics, advertising tracking, targetting, audience
        measurement, and more.   Some sites have more than 10 tags per page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each tag adds either HTML or JavaScript to the page adding to its
        weight: more tags means larger pages which means longer load times.
      </p>
      <p>
        And each tag ends up reading the same information from the page, such
        as its name, which can lead to inconsistencies.  Problems associated
        with page loads may cause one tag to fire and another to misfire: that
        leads to inconsistent results and headaches for web site owners in
        interpreting data from different tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        jsHub is designed to eliminate these problems by replacing many tags
        with a single tag.  The single jsHub tag reads data once from the page, 
        fires once, and replaces existing tags by sending data in native formats
        to different vendors&rsquo; products.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that implementing a tag-based product on your site should 
        not be an expensive exercise that locks you in to a single provider.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Who benefits from jsHub?</h2>
      <p>
        Vendors benefit because cross product data problems are eliminated as
        data is read once,  they can use common code eliminating most of their
        tag maintenance, and tag installation becomes easier as jsHub becomes
        widely adopted. <br/>
        See the <a href="/standards/">standards pages</a> for more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Web site owners benefit from improved consistency of information
        across different products, lower tag weight and the assurance that the
        tag is widely tested and secure. <br/>
        For more on the cost of implementation, see the <a href="/enterprise/">enterprise
        page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>With the Tag Inspector web site owners can self-service and check
        tag implementation.<br/>
        On the <a href="/projects/demos/">demo site</a>, you can see the 
        inspector in action.
      </p>
      <p>
        End users benefit from faster page load times and greater
        transparency.  With a single tag pages are smaller and faster to
        load.  With the Tag Inspector an end user can quickly see what
        information is being gathered about them.
