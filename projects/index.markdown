# Projects #

## jsHub tag ##
The jsHub tag project consists of a JavaScript tag, with associated tools and documentation. The tag has a flexible plug-in architecture. The jsHub project will supply a core set of plugins, including a plug-in that can read [hPage](/hPage) and other standard microformats. 

Vendors can also supply plugins to read their own markup. If a plugin is available to read the markup on your pages, then you can begin using the jsHub tag immediately. The tag and the markup are independent and each can be deployed on their own without the other.

## Microformat markup specifications ##

The other main project is an open specification for marking up metadata about pages viewed by users and is intended for web analytics and related solutions.

## Tag Inspector ##
The Tag Inspector provides a simple, user friendly view of the tag and all data collected on the page.  The Inspector works in a browser and can be accessed directly whenever a page of interest is being viewed. You can see the Inspector in action by visiting our demo store.

## Demo Store ##
The jsHub.org demo store is an online store front used to demonstrate the hPage specification, the jsHub tag and the Inspector.
