# The Demo Store #

The jsHub Demo Store is the first reference implementation of [microformat markup](/projects/markup/), used to test how the markup is used in practice.

* [Enter the demo store](/retail/)

The goal of the store is to help us to develop best practice for implementing semantic markup about each page, and to provide a solid working example for site owners implementing the markup themselves.

Microformats for marking up ecommerce functionality are under development, and will be incorporated into the store as a reference point.

## The Inspector and microformats ##
The demo store showcases the [Tag Inspector](/projects/inspector/). Within the demo store click on the inspector icon (bottom right of every page), to see the events that have been parsed from the microformat data on the page. You can compare this with the HTML view of microformats at the bottom of each page.

## Technology ##
The store is based on the [Spree ecommerce platform](http://spreecommerce.com/). 

Additional markup, product catalog, and other content are provided by the jsHub team.
