## What is a Universal Tag? (Fiann)
Business focussed definition of the project and why are we doing it.
 1. (done) Intro to concept of universal tag
 2. (done) Universal tag vs universal data
 3. Universal format for JS events - AJAX, Flash tracking
 4. Migration path for existing clients to adopt microformats

## Configurator architecture (Fiann)
The tag consists of chunks of code supplied by multiple vendors. At least some of the vendors would like to host the configuration tool themselves, or at least an entry point to it, which means you can configure data from a third party. How do you ensure the latest versions and the SLAs so that vendors are not beholden to each other?

## FAQ (Liam)
Create an FAQ and post about its existence:
 1. How to keep informed - twitter, blog, mailing lists, IM
 2. Are we a Universal Tag - no, we are about Universal Data and reference implementations
 3. Is there a jsHub server? no, therfore no dependecy, downtime or performance worries
 4. You are Open Source? yes, Github link
 5. What about the Inspector and Configurator source code? Planned to release, happy to give advanced access anyone who asks.
 6. And what about Demo Store source code? Already based on Spreecommerce.
 7. What OS projects do you use? jQuery, Rhino, YUI, env-js, RoR, Flowplayer, RunCodeRun, Github, git, svn, Hudson, Firebug
 8. Tag weight?

## jsHub tag features (Liam)
The features and functionality of the jsHub tag in addition to traditional analytics tags:
 1. Event driven - jsHub.trigger() and lifecycles
 2. HTML DOM value excerpting
 3. Multiple instances
 4. Extensible via plugins
 5. API for comon tasks - get data, sent data
 6. Introspection points for the Inspector
 7. Test suite
 8. Open source development, bug fixes and security processes

## Do users use GA features? (Liam)
Follow-up post: From Spidey data analysis make some reports on the raw use of GA as a hit counter vs. actually setting a page-name or other attributes.

## Using Cuzillion to understand tagging performance (Liam)
Step through examples to analyse a web page, turn it into a Cuzillion page and get real results

## Researching a microformat proposal and the process (Liam)
## Using wildcard DNS and base href for client mockups (Liam)
## Using HTML mark-up with GA - very simple approach (Liam)
## Using hPage/microformat mark-up with other vendors - more advanced approach (Fianno)

## Other past suggestions

 1. Challenges of retagging a site
 2. Why the inspector is interesting compared with other things like Ghostery)
 3. Security worries around thirdparty JavaScript (reference recent ny times problem) 
 4. Technical post about page weight --> FAQ
 5. Find and ref an intro to microformats for the novice
 6. Future of web tracking (eg flash, silverlight, etc.)
 7. Ref that geekatlas.com is using jshub
 8. Google's proposal to make Ajax indexable - http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html
 9. Inefficiency of multiple tags -> using Cuzillion
 10. Inaccuracy of multiple tags and the different counts given by different products
 11. Spidey data analysis - the rise of GA (JGC)
 13. What is 'tag weight'?
