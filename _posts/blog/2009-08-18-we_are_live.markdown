An obligatory post (on my birthday no less) to state that after a long time in steath-mode, being discreet with friends and colleagues, and hoping the Internet does not move on too quickly and leave us irrelevant, [jsHub.org](http://jshub.org/) is now live and we are able to openly discuss what we are doing and why.

Very much looking forward to where this takes us.
