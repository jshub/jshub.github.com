# About the jsHub project #

jsHub.org is a non-profit organization sponsoring [a number of projects](/projects/). Our goal is to make data capture for web analytics and other online optimization solutions more professional.

The project founders are Fiann O'Hagan and Liam Clancy. 

Liam and Fiann have many years of professional experience deploying JavaScript for data capture and secure content targeting on some of the highest traffic enterprise websites on the web. 

The jsHub project is our attempt to solve the problems that we saw replicated time after time when rolling out solutions to large websites.
