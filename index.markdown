Do you have web analytics on your site? Perhaps a product recommendations engine? Or an A/B testing tool? 

So why do they all they need the same data, but collected separately and each in their own format?

# A new approach #

jsHub is all about standards. We believe it's your data. And if you have declared it once, you should be able to use it for all the products that make your site work.
