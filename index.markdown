  We are bringing <strong><a href="/projects/jshub/">open source</a></strong> and 
  <strong><a href="/projects/markup/">open standards</a></strong> to tagging.

    <h1>What?</h1>
    
    <p>jsHub provides a new implementation of a <a href="/projects/jshub/">data collection tag</a>.</p>
    <p>
      For JavaScript developers, the tag code is <strong>tested with robust unit tests</strong>, and is
      open source so you can check the security.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with tools</h2>
    <p>
      We provide a <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a> which shows all the data that is 
      being collected on the page. No more debugging your implementation by
      monitoring HTTP traffic and unescaping query strings in your head!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/projects/inspector/"><img src="/images/inspector/3InspectorOverview.png" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with best practice</h2>
    <p>
      There is a <a href="/projects/demos/">demo store</a> which shows the tag, markup and tag inspector
      working together. Giving you a real life example of how to deploy the code.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Comes with tests</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a JavaScript developer, come and see how we do fully automated, cross-browser, continuous
      integration testing. How was our last build? You'll find the status and details of all the developer
      activity on the <a href="/projects/">projects page</a>.

    <h1>Why?</h1>
    
    <p>
      You need web analytics. You need mail tracking, recommendations, and a bunch of other tools on 
      your site. But you need to <strong>tag once</strong>, and keep all the data in one place.      
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that implementing a tag-based product on your site should not be an expensive exercise
      that locks you in to a single provider.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Standards for markup</h2>
    <p>
      We are leading an effort to define standards for markup. This means that you will only need to 
      declare data about the page (for example, a page name) and it can be used by multiple products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find out more on the <a href="/standards/">standards page</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Saves you money</h2>
    <p>
      Using a jsHub tag to perform your implementation saves you money. We can make life simpler in 
      two ways: by using a single tag (with plugins) to perform the same role as multiple vendor tags,
      and by using open standard markup which can be read by multiple tags.
