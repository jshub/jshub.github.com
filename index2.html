      It is common for web pages to contain many different tracking tags used for web analytics, ad tracking, targeting, audience measurement, and more. Some sites have more than 10 tags per page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tag adds either HTML or JavaScript to the page adding to its weight: more tags means larger pages which means longer load times. And each tag ends up reading the same information from the page, such as its name, which can lead to inconsistencies.

    <p>
      jsHub is a <a href="/projects/">suite of tools</a> and a <a href="/standards/">set of standards</a> that allows you to declare data on your site once, and use it to power all the tag-based products you use.
    </p>
    <p class="calltoaction">
      <a href="/retail/">&rarr; See it in action in the demo site</a>

  <li id="developers">
    <h1>Standard code</h1>
    <p>
      The jsHub tag is written in JavaScript and distributed under the BSD open source license.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a robust plugin architecture to provide consistent data to multiple products.
    </p>

      If you are a JavaScript developer, come and see how we do fully automated, cross-browser, continuous integration testing.

    <h1>
      Standard data
    </h1>
    <p>
      To ensure that data is only declared once we propose a <a href="/hPage/">page markup standard</a> based on HTML microformats, and released into the public domain, for common page metadata.
    </p>
    <div class="right" style="margin: 0 0.1em 0 0.6em; width: 55%;">
      <pre class="brush: html; light: true;">
        &lt;div class="hpage">
          &lt;span class="name">Homepage&lt;/span>
        &lt;/div>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Declaring metadata means writing HTML, not JavaScript code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Microformat data can be indexed by search engines, and can be properly integrated with your CMS. And you only declare it once.

      We believe that implementing a tag-based product on your site should not be an expensive exercise in repeating yourself, and it should not lock you in to a single "universal tag" provider.

      If you run a site, jsHub can help you</a> with consistent information across different products, lower tag weight and the assurance that the tag is widely tested and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      For large sites, implementing a tab-based solution can be a significant expense. Using jsHub tags allows you to implement any further products simply by adding the right plugin to your tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are maintaining a smaller site, you can use our <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a> to self-service and check what is actually being sent from your tag implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your end users benefit from faster page load times and greater transparency. With the Tag Inspector an end user can quickly see what information is being gathered on the page.

    <h1>
      Use jsHub to power your product
    </h1>
    <p>
      If your product uses tags to collect data from pages, then it is likely that your customers are spending time to reconcile your numbers with other products. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also likely that implementing the tags is a significant expense. This makes it harder for prospective clients to try your product, and can cause a never-ending implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unifying the markup on the site makes life easier for your customers and alleviates these problems. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Cross product data problems are eliminated as data is read once. Your customers can use common code to remove most of their tag maintenance, and tag installation becomes easier as jsHub becomes widely adopted.
