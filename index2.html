      It is common for web pages to contain many different tracking tags used for web analytics, audience measurement, optimization, and more. Some sites have more than 10 tags per page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tag adds some code to a web page, increasing its weight and causing longer load times. And each tag reads the same information from the page, which can lead to inconsistencies.

      jsHub is a <a href="/projects/">suite of tools</a> and a <a href="/standards/">set of standards</a>. It allows you to declare data once, and use it to power all the tag-based products on your site.

    <h1>Implement tags for the last time</h1>
    <p>
      For large sites, implementing a tag-based solution can be a significant expense. But with jsHub, it is only necessary to do it once. Any future products can be deployed simply by adding the relevant plugin to your tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are maintaining a smaller site yourself, you can self-service, without writing JavaScript code. Use our friendly <a href="/projects/inspector/">Tag Inspector</a> to check what is actually being sent from your tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the site, jsHub can help you with consistent information across different products, lower tag weight and the assurance that the tag is widely tested and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your end users benefit from faster page load times and greater transparency. With the Tag Inspector an end user can quickly see what information is being gathered on the page.

      Standard data
    </h1>
    <p>
      To ensure that data is only declared once we propose a <a href="/hPage/">page markup standard</a> based on HTML microformats, and released into the public domain, for common page metadata.
    </p>
    <div class="right" style="margin: 0 0.1em 0 0.6em; width: 55%;">
      <pre class="brush: html; light: true;">
        &lt;div class="hpage">
          &lt;span class="name">Homepage&lt;/span>
        &lt;/div>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Declaring metadata means writing HTML, not JavaScript code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Microformat data can be indexed by search engines, and can be properly integrated with your CMS. And you only declare it once.
    </p>

      We believe that implementing a tag-based product on your site should not be an expensive exercise in repeating yourself. It should not lock you in to a single "universal tag" provider.

      Use jsHub to power your product
    </h1>
    <p>
      If your product uses tags to collect data from pages, then it is likely that your customers are spending time to reconcile your numbers with other products. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also likely that implementing the tags is expensive and time consuming. This makes it harder for prospective clients to try your product, and can cause a never-ending implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A standards-based implementation will make life easier for your customers and alleviate these problems. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Cross product data problems are eliminated as data is read once. Your customers can use common code to remove most of their tag maintenance, and tag installation becomes easier as jsHub becomes widely adopted.
